# HuskyLens-training

The HuskyLens, an AI camera sensor, offers a diverse platform for researching computer vision concepts. This case study goes into the functionalities of the HuskyLens, including face recognition, object tracking, object recognition, line tracking, color recognition, and tag recognition (DFRobot, n.d.).

## Face Recognition:
The HuskyLens showed accuracy in detecting and recognizing human faces. While successful at front face recognition, issues occurred when dealing with different angles and lighting conditions. To improve accuracy, many angles of the same face should be captured during the learning process.

## Object Tracking:
The object tracking function was accurate in following specific objects within the camera's range of view. The system's capacity to continuously learn and adapt to object movements contributed to better tracking accuracy over time. However, problems were identified when tracking items with similar appearances or when there were multiple things in the camera's view.

## Object Recognition:
The HuskyLens' power to detect pre-defined things was excellent, with accurate recognition of objects from its built-in database. However, the system's shortcomings were obvious when attempting to differentiate between similar things or recognize objects not included in the database.

## Line Tracking:
The line tracking function displayed steady performance in following lines, making it suitable for robotic navigation tasks. The system's ability to project line paths increased its effectiveness. Challenges were encountered when dealing with complicated line patterns or shifting lighting conditions.

## Color Recognition:
The color Recognition function was typically accurate, with the ability to differentiate between numerous colors. However, difficulties developed while working with identical colors or under shifting lighting conditions.

## Tag Recognition: 
The HuskyLens recognized and tracked AprilTags precisely. An AprilTag is a visual fiducial system, useful for a wide variety of tasks including augmented reality, robotics, and camera calibration.
